One of the first programming mini-projects I remember building was a C++ console application which allowed the user to sort numbers.

User-Inputs:
1: Move all numbers left 1 space
|1 4| 2 3 5 -> |4 2| 3 5 1

2: Move all numbers right 1 space
|1 4| 2 3 5 -> |5 1| 4 2 3 

3: Swap the order of numbers within |x y|
|1 4| 2 3 5 -> |4 1| 2 3 5

The program completes when the numbers are in order ie: 
|1 2| 3 4 5

In my professional career I've utilized reinforcement learning and thought this would be a cool sample problem to tackle with various RL algos.
